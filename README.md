# Focus Detection Project

A sophisticated focus detection system using computer vision and machine learning techniques to analyze facial features and determine attention levels.

## Features

- Real-time face detection and tracking
- 68-point facial landmark detection
- Eye aspect ratio (EAR) calculation
- Head pose estimation
- Gaze direction tracking
- Blink detection and rate calculation
- Personalized calibration system
- Focus scoring algorithm
- Comprehensive data visualization
- Dataset evaluation capabilities

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FocusDetectionProject.git
cd FocusDetectionProject
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# or
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:
